# Music Folder

Place your MP3 music files here.

## File naming convention:

Name files according to the configuration in `script.js`:
- `track1.mp3`
- `track2.mp3`
- `track3.mp3`
- `track4.mp3`
- `track5.mp3`
- `track6.mp3`

Or use custom names and then update the corresponding `file` paths in `script.js`.

## Supported formats:
- `.mp3` (recommended)
- `.ogg`
- `.wav`

## File size recommendation:
- Single file < 10MB
- If files are too large, use Git LFS or compress the audio

## Album covers:
Add cover images in the `images/` folder:
- `cover1.jpg` ~ `cover6.jpg`
- Recommended size: 500x500px
